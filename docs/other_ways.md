**There are a ton of easy ways to help bees without the commitment of beekeeping or gardening. Even if you do want to do one of those things, it may not be the right season or you might live in an area where that is unachievable. The good thing is, there are a lot more ways to help bees! These are only a few ideas, so if you really want to help, make sure to look at other ways!**

* **While it may not be a full garden, having a window box or even potted plants on your windowsill can help bees. It’s not as much work as a full garden and it can be done in more urban environments.** <br>

* **Help out a local botanical garden or local beekeeping organization. Try volunteering in local or state parks, too.**

* **There are tons of places to donate in order to help bees, including several universities that study bees, like the University of Minnesota’s Bee Lab.** 

* **Buying local honey is an easy way to help out local beekeepers. Plus, it could help out with seasonal allergies.**

* **Bee houses are easy to buy and offer shelter to native bees. You have to pay attention to it during the season changes, but other than that, it’s an easy way to help shelter some bees without becoming a beekeeper.** 

* **Join a citizen science program! There are a ton of them out there to help with the declining bee population and pollinators in general.**

* **Support land conservation in your area! Start community gardens and help support existing ones!**
